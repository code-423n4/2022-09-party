So ts tests are more "high level" and testing integration with Seaport, while foundry test are more "low level" contract (unit) testing?


[09/12/2022 9:30 PM] merklejerk
yeah, for the most part, but we also have some integration style tests written in foundry


[09/12/2022 9:31 PM] merklejerk
we kind of pivoted mid-process so there's a mix between them

It's mind boggling how the devs consciously risk themselves to criticals by avoiding explicit reentrency guards to save a couple of warm SLOAD/SSTOREs. Says something about how confident they are with solidity


[09/14/2022 4:03 PM] merklejerk
Yup, that's why they were explicitly called out in the README. Excellent places to start looking for vulns.

https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/main/contracts/crowdfund/Crowdfund.sol/#L414 Do these blocks add a feature to the code or are just for styling? I have also noticed them in other projects, where they don't seem to add any value. I understand they could block scope variables, but in this case they don't seem to be doing that.


[09/18/2022 4:08 AM] brianle
we don't need the `CrowdfundLifecycle lc` after its checked so we just scope it, its just habit

doesnt do any harm


[09/18/2022 10:27 AM] 0xa5df
It's also good for preventing `stack too deep` errors, in this case it's not needed but in case you have too many local variables in the function it can cause this error and scoping them can prevent that
